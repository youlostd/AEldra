[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. How to obtain a Costume Sash.

Costume Sashes are sold from the Theowahdan 'Sash Shop' and they require 25x Fine Cloth and 5x of the 
corresponding Medallion. For example, to buy a Sash of Hai (basic) you need 5x Hai Medallion and 25x Fine Cloth.
The corresponding Medallions are dropped from the final boss of each portal of the Zodiac Temple.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]3. How to combine a Costume Sash.

The combination process is pretty much the same as the one from the Shoulder Sash System. 
Costume Sashes of the same grade of quality can be combined to craft a higher quality costume sash, 
although this process can fail. When it does so, the second costume sash in the Combination Window is destroyed.
The Combination Window is reachable through the "Combination" option from Theowahdan. 
Angel & Devil Wings can also be combined with costume sashes of the same grade but different type.
