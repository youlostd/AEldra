[CENTER_ALIGN]Over the past decades, knowledge of the Runes began to spread around Aeldra, 
[CENTER_ALIGN]as more were unearthed. The world's brightest minds, shamans, have studied thoroughly 
[CENTER_ALIGN]the ancient glyphs,collected information from the depths of the history and attempted 
[CENTER_ALIGN]to gather and determine the powers that they could possess. The sheer power held within them, 
[CENTER_ALIGN]was nowhere close to being translated and manipulated by our hands. Some surmised that their 
[CENTER_ALIGN]powers lured Jotun Thrym into the, as of today known, world of Aeldra. Those we managed to
[CENTER_ALIGN]subdue are the ones nowdays people are using. Who knows what else is left in the depths of Metin2.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]1. Introduction of the Rune System

The system allows players to customize their character growth for specific tasks, such as PvP & PvM, 
by choosing from a wide variety of Runes. You can reach the system through the F5 shortcut.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.1 Primary Trees

There are 5 different Primary Trees that the player can choose to work on: 

*Precision
*Dominance
*Magic
*Determination
*Inspiration

After the player has picked his Primary Tree, he selects a Key Rune and 3 more runes 
to complete his tree based on his needs.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.2 Secondary Trees

Secondary Trees are combined with the Primary Trees to forge a complete Rune Page. 
The player picks another tree to combine and then selects 2 runes from that tree(Key Runes excluded)

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.3 Control Buttons

In the top right corner of the Rune System Tab, you can find 4 control buttons: 

*Reset
*Reset Points
*Buy Points
*Save

In the bottom right corner of the Rune System Tab, you can find the Rune System Tutorial 
along with the 4 available Rune Pages. To switch between the Trees, click on the Tree Icon 
on the top before you save the Rune Page. When all 6 runes have bee unlocked and selected, 
you can save the current Rune Page to apply it to your character. Saved Runes can be reset 
with the 'Reset Points' button and saved Rune Pages can be reset with the "Reset" button.
Runes that are active appear in your affect list, in the top left corner of your screen.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. How to unlock runes?

To unlock a Key Rune (or a normal rune), you need 12 Rune Points.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]2.1 Rune Points

You can buy 1 Rune Point through the 'Buy Points' button in the top right corner of the Rune System Tab.
In the beginning and until you have 145 Rune Points, a Rune Point will require items from the 110Lv 
metin stones, in the 90Lv maps & 6.000.000 yang. After the 145th Rune Point and until the 
720th Rune Point (max), Rune Points will require items from the Metin of the Tree Beings, 
in 105Lv maps & 6.000.000 yang.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]2.2 Unlocking & Selecting a Rune

When you have 12 points available, click on the Rune you would like to unlock. After that, 
select the rune with the left mouse button and then press 'Save' for the bonuses to apply.
Attention: Now your page is saved and you cannot swap trees. If you'd like so, 
go the the second Rune Page and start over.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]3. Frequently Used Tree Paths & Pro Tips

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]3.1 PvM popular Tree Path (for metin stones)

Primary Tree, Dominance: Soul Robbery, Monster, Boss, Metin.
Secondary Tree, Precision: Average Damage, Critical Damage.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]3.2 PvM popular Tree Path (for bosses)

For boss farming, you usually go with the tree path for metin stones and you change the "Metin" 
and the others to the most convenient Rune. For example: During a Zodiac Temple run, it's easier 
if you switch "Metin" to "Zodiac" rune and so on...

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]3.3 Pro Tips

When killing a boss, switching to 'Thief' and 'Itemdrop' runes in another Rune Page at the last 
moment will maximize your chances for loot. The Rune 'Reinforced Dew Potions' should be used 
before you enable dews in order to receive greater amount of buffs. You need 1140 pieces of each 
item from the 90Lv maps & 3450 pieces of each item from the 105Lv maps to unlock all the available Lv1 runes.
As soon as you unlock 12/12 runes from your Primary Tree, you also receive a bonus of 
15% Strong against Half Human & 10% Defense against Half Human.
