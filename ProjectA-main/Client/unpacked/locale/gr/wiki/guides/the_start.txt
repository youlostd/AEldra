[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]1. Basic server features/systems before you start

In your beginning, you should take your time to discover what's new in our server and how to use basic features. 
Don't rush to level up, it's not a race! Also, make sure to walk around the city and explore the NPCs before 
you start your adventures in Aeldra... As a gift from us, you got a 7 days mount, pet, Ring of Joy, and others 
to provide you a smooth beginning.


[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.1. Storerooms, Shop Search & Switchbot

By opening your Inventory (I), you should see 3 new buttons in the top right corner of it. Let's see what they are.
The first one opens your Storerooms. There are 5 different Storerooms: Materials, Books, Stones, Enchants & Costumes. 
Items that you collect will be automatically assigned to a storeroom to keep your inventory clear and organized. 
The second button opens the Shop Search. This will be your favorite feature, since you'll use it all the time. 
It searchers all around, finds the item that you want in the best price & lets you buy it without a lot of troubles. 
Click on the name of the item you searched to mark the location of theshop. Give it a try, it's free...  The last 
button opens the Switch Bot. Things are simple here. Drag and drop an item, choose the bonuses you want and let 
the system roll it until you have them.


[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.2. F6 Shortcut - Quest Timer

We have designed a unique tab to gather as much information as possible and make it super functional. 
By pressing the F6 button, you have it infront of your eyes. Now you'll find your Biologist Missions and your 
dungeons entrances & cooldowns. Super cool huh? Use it to check timers & teleport to places.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.3 Vote4Buff
By now, you might have noticed that you have a mission called "Vote4Buff". By logging in our website 
you can vote our server and receive a 24 hours buff from your panel. Don't worry... After 24h, you can 
repeat the process to enjoy permanently 1 of the following buffs: 

*20% Experience Bonus
*20% Monsters
*20% Increased Item drop


[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.4 Private Shop

You have surely noticed there's a Shop button in your Inventory. With 100.000 yang, 
you can open a Shop. From there, you can sell items without even being online. 
Just add them there and wait for someone to make you rich.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. Battlepass, First Missions & Education

You might have also noticed that you don't have the classic Apprentice Chests. Who needs them? 
You got the Battlepass.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]2.1 Battlepass

By clicking this item, you will 7 normal missions & 3 Legendary missions. This is probably 
the most important feature you have as a beginner. Completing each mission is quite simple and will 
reward you with fundamental equipment, such as: Rune Items, Master Sash(custom), Cor Draconis(Legendary), etc...
Make sure to start the missions as soon as possible.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]2.2 First Missions
Okay, all set with the Battlepass. What about the other missions?
Well, the moment you reach 5Lv your missions journey begins. Uriel & Biologist will always keep 
in touch with you so make sure to check what they need everytime. Alchemy will also assign you 
a mission to unlock the Dragon Stone Alchemy system. Keep an eye for his mission at 30Lv.
It's recommended that you start the missions early enough to enjoy some valuable rewards later on.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]2.3 Education
When you reach 5Lv, you are able to choose your class and start your education. Add points to train 
skills up to M1 and then use books provided from the Teachers to train them further.
Don't forget to buy Exorcism Scrolls & Concentrated Reading from Hong-Hae. Everything is on your demand...


[IMG=d:/ymir work/ui/wiki/divider_long.tga; Y=1025; CENTER_ALIGN]

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]3. Items you start collecting & must-buy items

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]3.1 Crystals
By this time you must have destroyed a couple of metin stones and realised that they drop plenty of 
crystals (in your Materials Storeroom). There's a great reason for that. Tourmaline, Emerald, Sapphire, 
Ruby & Garnet crystals work as a second-currency in many NPCs. That's why we start providing a lot, 
so that you always buy what you need. It is recommended that you keep them for you personal use, 
but selling them comes handy when you're out of money. Make sure to check the average price from your 
shop to have a better idea of the prices. Don't get fooled...

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]3.2 Enchantment Chest, Herb Chest
These nice looking chests are really worth for you. 
Enchantment chests provide you with Reinforce Item, Enchant Item & Blessing Marble 
to customize your equipment bonuses. Herb chests include all kinds of ingredients 
for your potion manufactoring from Huahn-So (Jayang, Bokjung, Bakra).
Both are extremely useful for beginners and even for pros. 

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]3.3 Must-buy items
It is quite early to mention these items, but having a solid target will help you redirect:

*Level 80 Helmet for youÂ´re Race

*Linen Belt
[COLOR=808476;X_PADDING=20]*Can be can be crafted at the Alchemist

The ones you receive in the beginning will not last forever, so you better start 
collecting money for these 3 permanent companions...

[COLOR=808476;X_PADDING=20]*30% Strength against Metinstones.

*Baby Lion Seal:
[COLOR=808476;X_PADDING=20]*Max. HP 2.000

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]4. Leveling Paths: 30Lv, 50Lv, 75Lv+

Here are the leveling paths which at the moment are the most viable and easy ways to level up yourself:

[COLOR=ef4f00]Level 1 - Level 30
*Shinsoo
*Yajang

*Chunjo
*Bokjung

*Jinno
*Bakra

[COLOR=ef4f00]Level 30 - Level 42
*Valley of Seungryong
*Spider Dungeon 1
*Spider Dungeon 2

[COLOR=ef4f00]Level 42 - Level 61
*Mount Sohan
*Hwang Temple
*Spider Dungeon 2
*Spider Dungeon 3

[COLOR=ef4f00]Level 61 - Level 81
*Ghost Woods
*Red Forest
*Spider Dungeon 3

[COLOR=ef4f00]Level 81 - Level 90
*Red Forest 
*Grotto of Exile 1
*Grotto of Exile 2

Remember, pushing yourself to gain levels over dropping items is not always good. For example, 
taking your time and farming in Ghost Woods & Red Forest is preferred than leveling up
in Spider Dungeon, because Ghost Woods & Red Forest will be your yang-paradise at this point. 
This guide is all about "The Start", so let's not extend to further level paths for now...


[IMG=d:/ymir work/ui/wiki/divider_long.tga; Y=2230; CENTER_ALIGN]

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]5. How do I increase my damage?

At this point, your damage should start to bother you. 
You realise that time is money and you want the best result possible. 
Well, here's your guidance:

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.1 Aura of the Sword / Enchanted Blade L
If you're Sura Weaponry or Warrior Body, you want these 2 skills at the maximum stage. 
Which, surprisingly, is not P. Skills extend up to L (Legendary) and can be 
trained with Legendary Soulstones.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.2 Vote4Buff (20% Strength against Monsters)
Up to this point, 20% Experience bonus was really not bad. If you want to maximize your profits from metinstones, 
20% Strength against Monsters is your way to go...

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.3 Dragon Stone Alchemy
You should have enough Cor Draconis to start blending. Your goal for now is to make a 
Legendary Dragon Ruby (Excellent)+6, with at least 15% Average Damage, 120 Attack Value & Defense. Work on it...

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.4 Sash with at least 13% Average Damage
A sash would fit perfect on you, it's true. Start searching for one with at 
least 13% Averag Damage and +3 Strength to improve your damage.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.5 Rune System (F5)
The Rune System is a complex one and is described thoroughly in another guide. Although, in a sum, 
it provides you with 20% PvE bonuses & status points that you are surely intrested. Take a look.

[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]5.6 Dews
Dews manufactoring is a big aspect of the game and you should definitely try at Huahn-So. 
Later on, you can use these dews to produce the permanent versions of them.


[IMG=d:/ymir work/ui/wiki/divider_long.tga; Y=2650; CENTER_ALIGN]

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]6. My first dungeons

You might be thinking that you are nowhere near a dungeon, right? Wrong! You can start completing dungeons 
from as early as 30Lv. Orc Maze, Spider Baroness & Devil's Catacombs are some casual dungeons to start with. 
Make sure to check for guides before you do so...


[IMG=d:/ymir work/ui/wiki/divider_long.tga; Y=2750; CENTER_ALIGN]

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]7. How to become a millionaire

At this point, there's a great chance that you're already a 'millionaire'. 
But what's going to make you rich enough in your early stages of the server? 
Well, there are surely some tips. Ghost Woods & Red Forest as mentioned before, 
is a yang-paradise for players around 85Lv. Why's that? Because you can easily drop 
Emerald Crystals and Yang Coupons from metinstones. The Emerald Crystals are only 
droppable up until the 90Lv metinstones, so you're pretty much in the best map to farm them. 
They are sold in prices that will let you easily grab some Soul Crystal items and also make enough money
to craft/buy a good 75Lv weapon & other equipment for your future maps. A wise old man once said: 
Stay in Red Forest until you have all the must-buy items menntioned above. 
Then continue your adventures in the 90Lv+ maps. From now on, you can visit the guide 
'105 and what now?' to continue your adventures... Have fun!
