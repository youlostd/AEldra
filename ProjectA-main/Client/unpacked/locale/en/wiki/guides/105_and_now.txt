[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]1. The adventures after 105Lv & the Battlepass of the Tree

At this point, you are considered a middle-end player since you are close to becoming maximum level. 
Although, you probably noticed that things get a little more challenging...


[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.1 Enchanted Forest & Dark Forest

You are now able to teleport to your fresh new maps, Enchanted & Dark Forest. Those maps are full 
of small treasures that you'll discover one by one. Firstly, you'll need to adjust your equipment, 
because as mentioned before: Things get a little more challenging. Monsters here do not have an 
active race bonus, although they are 'Earth' labeled, meaning that an Earth Talisman+49 is good to have. 
Also, their damage is signifincatly increased, compared to 90Lv maps, so maximizing your 'Chance to block', 
'Max. HP' & 'Absorb HP' bonuses will come handy. A Legendary Dragon Onyx & Jade (supposingly you already 
have a Ruby+6) along with +5 Evasion & Defense stones in your armor will ensure you stay alive while 
farming Metins of the Tree Beings.


[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.2 Mission Book (royal) ?

You will now also start dropping Mission Books (royal) from now on. It contains a set of missions, 
one at a time, which will be rewarded upon successful completion. Most of the missions are dungeons-related, 
so if you're comfortable go ahead and activate them. If not, selling them is an option too. Beware that the 
rewards are juicy (Legendary Soulstones, Boss Roll(heavy), etc...)


[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]1.3 Battlepass of the Tree

You've seen the Battlepass again, back in the old days you were 1Lv. Here it comes again, a little bit reworked.
It includes 7 normal missions and 3 Legendary missions. The rewards are adjusted to your needs, 
so work on them as soon as possible.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. What's with those costumes?

Until now, you've probably been refreshing those 3x10% beginner costumes or you managed to grab some 3x15% 
costume bonuses. Well, you're not finished. Special Events take place from times to times and they usually 
include 20% costume bonuses either for your weapon or your hairstyle. You should start seeking for them...

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]3. A short dungeons explanation

You have just unlocked the gates of Jotun Thrym and Ship Defense, the high-end dungeons, along with Nemere 
& Razador from earlier (95Lv). It seems like all the dungeons need keys... Well, it's not as dramatic as you think. 
Grabbing a Passage Ticket [or Boss Room Ticket (nemere)] will grant you access to Ship Defense too 
(since Nemere drops 100% Blue Crystal Essence) Same logic, Razador drops 100% Red Hell Quartz, used to enter the 
Cave of the Crystal Dragons. So, basically you just chain dungeons together and make yourself a significant profit.
Keep in mind that Cave of Crystal Dragons & Jotun Thrym are damage-based dungeons which require maxed out
bonuses. Keep in touch with our forum for more information...

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]4. Tourmaline Equipment

Don't you think it's time to get rid of those low-level Soul Crystal items? It is, indeed.
Tourmaline Earrings & Necklace grant you 15% Strength against Monsters and Metinstones, a fundamental 
improvement to your damage. Tourmaline Bracelet grants you 15% Strength against Monsters and bosses, 
which will allow you to start doing some high-end dungeons by yourself. In general, tourmaline equipment 
along with Fire Shoes, Dragon Crystal Belt, Dragon God Shield & Sea Serpent Helmet are crafted from Badawahdan 
(Cape Dragon Village). Take a look there too.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]5. How to defeat those monkeys.

It won't be long till you unlock Wukong's Temple as well (110Lv map), which will refine the way you farm.
Getting all Dragon Stone Alchemy +6 (for the extra bonuses), Wind Talisman+99, Sash Costume and maximizing 
your damage will start to bother you seriously from now on. In this map, you start farming great quantities 
of Chest of Supply, Dream & Sky Souls, Chest of Skills(for your special skills), as well as upgrading 
materials for your high-end equipment. Selling them or using them for your own equipment, will either 
way profit you and get you wealthy enough for the items mentioned before. You should also start wondering 
what's going on with the Zodiac Temple & Thranduil, right...?


[IMG=d:/ymir work/ui/wiki/divider_long.tga; Y=1120; CENTER_ALIGN]

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]6. Did I finish the server now?

Getting max level, doesn't apparently mean that you have gone through all of the aspects of the game. 
I'm sure you know that too.


[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]6.1 Zodiac Temple

Some of the toughest adventures will be held here, in the Zodiac Temple. It is time for you to get socialized 
and grab a team or guild to help you through this process. There are tons of new features, dungeon floors 
and rewards in this gigantic aspect of the game and it won't be easy to go through alone. Maximizing 
your equipment, upgrading all your talismans to +99 and forming a capable team may lead you to the 40th floor...
In a sum, you'll soon get rid of your beloved 75Lv weapon and start rolling and upgrading a Zodiac weapon. 
Same goes for your armor. Dealing with the 12 Zodiac Gods is not your casual cup of tea, so make sure to 
consult our forum for detailed information.


[COLOR=ef4f00;FONT_SIZE=15]6.2 Thranduil's Lair

This dungeon constists of new bosses, stages and many versatilities. 
You'll find some new techniques inside this lair and perhaps some Kyanite equipment? Who knows...
