[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. How to improve a shoulder sash.

A shoulder sash has 4 different grades of quality: basic, fine, noble and custom.
Sashes of the same grade of quality can be combined to craft a higher quality sash, although this process can fail.
When it does so, the second sash in the Combination Window is destroyed. The Combination Window is reachable 
through the "Combination" option from Theowahdan. A custom sash can be improved by combining it with another 
custom sash (any type). The improvement, if successfull, will increase the absorbtion rate from 1 to 5%

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]3. How to absorb a Weapon/Armor into your Sash.

You can use a sash to absorb the bonus from any weapon or armor. 
The armor or weapon used to be absorbed WILL BE DESTROYED.

*Basic Sashes absorb 1% of the bonus from an armor or weapon.
*Fine Sashes absorb 5% of the bonus from an armor or weapon.
*Noble Sashes absorb 10% of the bonus from an armor or weapon.
*Custom Sashes absorb 11% - 25% of the bonus from an armor or weapon.

The Bonus Absorption Window is reachable through the "Bonus Absorption" option from Theowahdan. 
Place the Sash in the left slot, the weapon or armour in the right slot, and you can see the final result in the bottom.
The process will transfer the % of both bonuses and stats of the Weapon/Armor to the sash 
(All the decimal digits are rounded decreasingly.)

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]4. How to remove the bonuses from a Sash.

Say that you made a mistake and absorbed the wrong Armor/Weapon to your Sash. Happens to everyone... or not.
Well, in that case, you cannot get your armor/weapon back but you can clear the bonuses 
from your Shoulder Sash with a Certificate of Reversal.
