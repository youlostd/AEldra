[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]3. Customizable fields & Cool Combinations.

A skill constists of the combination of many fields. For the purpose of individuality, we have divided 
each skill to 5 different fields that you can customize and get a total of 100% customizable skill.
If you change 1 out of 5 fields, it doesn't mean your skill will be 100% the color you picked. 
Only a part of it will be, so get started playing with the colors...
