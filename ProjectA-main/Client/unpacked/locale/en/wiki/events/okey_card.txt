[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]1. General Information

By defeating monsters you will collect Okey Collectable Cards during this Event.
The Okey Collectable Cards are an Alternative Drop, which means that every monster between +/- 15 Levels 
can drop them. Once you collected 24 Cards, you automatically receive an Okey Card Set.
From then on you are allowed to play the minigame. 
When the Event is active, an Okey Card Game icon will appear next to your minimap, 
from which you can open and play the game.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. Game Instructions

The goal is to get a combination of sets and runs.
A set consists of three cards with the same number (e.g. 7, 7, 7).
The lower the number on the cards, the fewer points you'll earn for the set.

A run consists of at least three consecutive cards (e.g. 6, 7, 8 ).
The lower the number on the cards, the fewer points you'll earn for the set.
Runs in the same color will earn more points than multicolored runs.

Left-click on the deck to reveal the first 5 cards.
Earn points by selecting 3 cards. (NOTE: Left-Click = Select card, Right-Click = Permanently discard card)
The more points you earn by the end of the game, the better your prize.
