[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]1. General Information:

You can enter the PvP map over a quest or at the Captain. 
Every round of the tournament will be random. So you have to compete against all races and not just against 
your own. When you enter the PvP Map, speak to the Admiral Angmur to register to the PvP Tournament.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]2. Event Instructions

As soon as you are teleported into the Special Map, which the Event is held, head towards the middle of the map.
You'll find there the Admiral Angmur, where you have to speak in order to register yourself.
To make it fair for every player, the PvP is executed in several different level ranges.
Depending on your level, you are put in a level range and now it's time for you to gather your items up.
There are 4 different arenas, where PvP Battles are completed individually.
When the Admiral Angmur finds a free arena for you and your opponent, you are automatically teleported inside.

When teleported inside the Arena, you have 10 seconds to sharpen your knives.
During this waiting time, you are only allowed to buff up and prepare, but not to move or fight.
The rounds are 'Best of 3', meaning that you just need 2 successive vitories.
The PvP Tournament is 'Knock-Out', meaning that it will only have 1 Final Winner (from each Level Range).

During your Battle, the following items/functions are disabled:

*Red Potion (S), (M) and (L)
*Sun Elixir (S), (M) and (L)
*Mounts
*Pets
*Buffi
*Team Buffs
