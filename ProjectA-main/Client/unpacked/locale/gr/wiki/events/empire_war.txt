Empire War is an Open PvP Event which takes place in a Special Map.
Every player which is at least 75 Level can participate and fight with his kingdom, against the other two kingdoms.
The teleport to this map will be reached by a teleport window which will appear in the middle of your screen, 
when the gates are open. The empire, which after 20 minutes scores the best K/D in % will win the Empire War.

When you teleport to this Special Map, you'll soon realise that everyone around you, except your own Kingdom, 
is an enemy. Hey buddy! Don't leave your guns at home. There's no Safezones to protect you there, 
so be sure to equip the right items on time. The time is running out... Don't forget that the goal is to score 
the best K/D in 20 minutes. Both time and performance of your kingdom is critical.
For the sake of your convenience, the following items are disabled during the Battle:

*Buffi Seal
*Mounts
*Wedding Ring
