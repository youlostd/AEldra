Ninjas are professional[ENTER]
killers, capable of carrying[ENTER]

To maximise their speed and[ENTER]
agility, these shadowy[ENTER]
assassins of the night wear[ENTER]
only the lightest armour, so[ENTER]

Depending on their[ENTER]
particular areas of[ENTER]
expertise, Ninjas can use[ENTER]
their mastery of the dagger[ENTER]
in close quarters, or wield[ENTER]
