Defeat monsters to earn cards. As soon as you've[ENTER]
collected and stacked together 24 Okey Cards,[ENTER]
you'll automatically receive an Okey Card Set[ENTER]
and can play a game. The aim of the game is to[ENTER]
make combinations of sets and runs.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
A set consists of three cards with the same[ENTER]
number (e.g. 7, 7, 7). The lower the number on[ENTER]
the cards, the fewer points you'll earn for the[ENTER]
set.[ENTER]
[ENTER]
A run consists of at least three consecutive[ENTER]
cards (e.g. 6, 7, 8). The lower the number on[ENTER]
the cards, the fewer points you'll earn for the[ENTER]
set. Runs in the same colour will earn more[ENTER]
points than multicoloured runs.[ENTER]
