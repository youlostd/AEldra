Your Gaya balance is the amount written in the left side of the Money Bar (next to your yang balance). 
You can use Gaya to buy items from Gaya Market. Gaya can't be moved in other characters and can't be traded. 
Gaya can be obtained by refining Gemstones at the Gaya Merchant.

You can get 1 Gaya by giving 10x Gemstones, 500.000 yang and a stone +0 - +3 to the Gaya Merchant 
(Pyungmoo, Yongan, Joan). The process cannot fail. Alternative, you can directly craft 10x Gaya by 
giving 100x Gemstones, 5.000.000 yang and 10 stones +0 - +3 to the Gaya Merchant. Again, the process cannot fail.
