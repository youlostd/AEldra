The files here wont be uploaded to the live server. If you are using the uncythonized launcher
(which is most likely for dev server) this files will be used when you pack root_dev.

Otherwise they will be cythonized. To do that select Cython_live configuration in visual studio, or
go to source\client\cython and run runcythonize.py (you have to install python27 first and add (if not
exists) python to your enviroment variables (pointing to python.exe) and PYTHONPATH (pointing to 
the python root folder))

By default the cythonizer will only rebuild the new/modified files, but if there is an error durning
the process its recommended to do a full rebuild (the cythonizer wont miss any file but the
compiler would since I just pass the new files to it in a txt manually)

To perform a full rebuild first run the FullClear.bat manually inside cython\root or uiscript\cyTemp
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

If you remove a .py file do a full rebuild with the cythonizer or just remove its files from
Source\client\cython\root or uiscript lib\cyTemp (its not important however, wont have any negative
effect except on the size of the .exe)

The cythonizer is              C  A  S  E       S  E  N  S  I  T  I  V  E             for filenames

which means if you add a new file lets say newfile.py and you use it like "import newFile" then 
the filename have to be newFile.py or you can add it to the 
Source\client\cython\RootLib\rootlibcythonizer.py's capNameList. (this is not necessary for uiscript
files)
