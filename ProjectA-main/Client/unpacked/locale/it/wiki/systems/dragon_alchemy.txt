[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]4. How to upgrade Dragon Stones.

As mentioned before, a max Dragon Stone has all 4 aspects maxed out. To start off, you need to maximize them in 
the correct order: Class -> Clarity -> Level. To upgrade the class of a Dragon Stone, you need more 
Dragon Stones of the same class. Put the needed dragon stone in the appropriate slots and click 
"Refine" or "Refine All". Once your Dragon Stone becomes Legendary, you can start upgrading it's clarity. 
To upgrade the clarity of a Dragon Stone, you need more Dragon Stones of the same clarity. Put the needed dragon
stone in the appropriate slots and click "Refine". Once your Dragon Stone becomes Excellent, you can start upgrading 
it's level. To upgrade the level of a Dragon Stone you need a Green Dragon Bean or Blue Dragon Bean or 
Pink Dragon Bean. Put the bean and one dragon stone in the appropriate slots and select "Refine". The process 
can fail and in this case the level of the Dragon Stone will be reduced by 1. Note that Blue and 
Pink Dragon Beans have higher success rate, but they still drop the level of the dragon stone in case of a fail.

[CENTER_ALIGN;FONT_SIZE=18;COLOR=58ADFF]5. How to refill Dragon Stone's duration.

Tongs of Time will allow you to create a Time Elixir (S). To create it you have to drag it on a non equipped 
Dragon Soul Stone (the stone will be removed from your DSS inventory and the elixir will appear in your inventory). 
This process can fail. You can also obtain Time Elixir (m) as a reward from the Golden Decimus Chest, 
King of the Crystal Dragons, Battlepass of the Tree (Mission: 'Mermaid Island'), Mission Book (hard) and from 
Kawuco.You can also craft a Time Elixir (L) at Kawuco. When the time runs out in a Dragon Stone, it becomes 
unusable and you stop receiving it's bonuses. It doesn't disappear.
