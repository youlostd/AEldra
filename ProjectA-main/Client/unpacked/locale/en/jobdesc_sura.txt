Suras are fighters who were[ENTER]
blessed with magical powers[ENTER]
when they agreed to allow[ENTER]
the Seed of Evil to grow in[ENTER]
their arms. The magic under[ENTER]
their control allows them to[ENTER]
inflict damage on their[ENTER]
enemies from afar, and they[ENTER]
make competent melee[ENTER]
fighters thanks to their[ENTER]
excellent swordsmanship.[ENTER]
Depending on their choice of[ENTER]
specialisation, Suras can[ENTER]
improve their attack spells[ENTER]
or develop additional[ENTER]
[WAIT]
strengthening spells.
